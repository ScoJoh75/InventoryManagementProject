# InventoryManagementProject
Little project that allows you to add parts to a system, and then create Products from those parts.

This project created multiple, interactive views that allowed a user to add parts into inventory, and then combine those parts into products.

The ability to search for parts and products was added. 

Various levels of testing for correctly entered information exist, as well as testing to ensure that you can not delete parts that are
inclded in product configurations.
